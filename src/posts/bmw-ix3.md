###With its 270 horsepower and around 250 miles of range, the all-electric iX3 will mark the beginning of a new chapter in BMW's electrification strategy.
<!-- end -->

When the new strategy is implemented you should be able to pick any model from all the company’s brands, and decide if you want to integrate a plug-in hybrid drive system or a battery-electric solution. 

For now the iX3 is BMW's only all-electric vehicle since the i3 from 2013, and in terms of design it  certainly takes a step in the right direction. No longer is the design completely differentiated just because it's an all-electric vehicle. Sure, the i-brand will have a few «electric» design accents, but all in all it looks a lot like the “normal” X3.
