###With its 270 horsepower and around 250 miles of range, the all-electric iX3 will mark the beginning of a new chapter in BMW's electrification strategy.

The iX3 will be a full-electric version of the BMW X, similar in design except for a grille-free nose and a few discrete “electric” details. This is the core of BMW's new “electrification strategy – you are supposed to be able to select a battery-electric engine for any BMW model in the future. 

With fifth generation BMW eDrive technology and a battery of 70+ kWh net capacity, the iX3 will be charged in 30 minutes with a 150 kW quick charger. Production scheduled to start in 2020.
