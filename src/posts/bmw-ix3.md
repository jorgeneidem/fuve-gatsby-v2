Due out in 2020, the iX3 will pack 270 horsepower and around 250 miles of range. The SAV (Sports Activity Vehicle) will mark the beginning of a new chapter in BMW's electrification strategy, where any models from all the companyâ€™s brands can integrate either a pure combustion engine, plug-in hybrid drive system or battery-electric solution, as desired.
